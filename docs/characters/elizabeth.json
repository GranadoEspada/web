  "DESC": "She became a famous painter at quite a young age. Because she doesn't know much of the world yet, she isn't fully aware of her reputation, painting solely for the pleasure of seeing people react to her works. She has created countless masterpieces, although some would make anyone go, \"What the hell!\" This happens because her works vary greatly according to her mood and physical condition.",
